# In python, if you create a class with one or more abstract methods,
# we will call it an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that will
# contain only declaration, no implementation. The class that inherits from abstract
# base class needs to implement all the base class abstract methods.
# Generally, the abstract classes are same as normal classes, but
# the only difference is the abstract classes will have one or more abstract methods.
# The abstract classes are useful when you want to provide a common interface for different
# implementations in derived classes.
# Python wonâ€™t provide direct support to the abstract classes.
# To implement abstract classes in python, you need to import the ABC (Abstract Base Classes)
# module and create the abstract methods in a base class. To create abstract methods,
# you need to create methods by decorating with the @abstractmethod attribute.
